Had some issues with my internet provider regarding ipv4 connections so i build a script that checks that for me in regular intervals. Also runs a speedtest every 15 minutes 'cause there were some issues too...

Simple python script that checks my internet connection in regular intervals. ;)

Disclaimer: I'm not so familiar with this python thingy.
